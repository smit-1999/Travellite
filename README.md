## Summary

BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus is situated on the outskirts of the city and travelling alone especially to the airport costs you a fortune! Travelling on bus with luggage is tiresome and inconvenient. It is therefore desired to find some people travelling to the same destination around the same time so that you could share a cab and hence save money. However finding the right people willing to share a cab with you is quite time consuming and requires a lot of
coordination.

Travel@BPHC : a Facebook group is used for finding people to share a cab where people share their travelling details through a post expecting others to notice and reply.But these Facebook
posts are bound to be mixed with other unimportant feed stuff,which often results in the person missing relevant posts regarding their journey. Also,most comments end up as spam in the
comments section.

**Enter Travellite !** 

We aim at building a website where people can post their travelling details and others can search applying appropriate filters.Users can create a new post. Other people can view this post and can choose which group to join as per their convenience. The post owner will be notified of joining requests from other members and can accept any one of his/her choice.Users can leave the group in case of schedule change and join another group without worrying about the hassle
involved in informing the other members of this change. At the end of each ride the application will display the cab fare and the respective dues.Users can also view their previous rides and
transaction history. This reduces the effort involved in finding the right cab sharing group and also removes the element of spam which is involved in the current situation.
